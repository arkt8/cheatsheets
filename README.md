# CheatSheets

Simple command line for self documentations

## Usage

Put your files under the `./docs directory` and just it.
Run `./cs` and your files can be fuzzy finded with side preview.

If you need to edit some file, just run `ctrl-e`.


## Dependencies

It relies in GNU `find` and `sort` command, `fzf` and `bat`.

By default, `vim` is used as editor. (imagine you issuing a Emacs or VSCode for edit 
a single file... It's not so productive :P)
